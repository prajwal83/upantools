---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an app used to parse Elf executable/dll structure
Helpful in analysing/debugging issues with elf exe/dlls that are copied to MOS filesystem for
execution or loading in MOS OS

MOSFSUtility 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a very useful tool to copy files to/from host filesystem to mos filesystem
It can be copied to a image file or an actual storage device which is formatted in mos filesystem
It would be really great if this can be extended to come up with a more easy way to copy files to/from
mos filesystem storage
